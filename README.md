## Python Latin Square Solver

A latin square of size m, is a mxm multiplication table in which each element occurs once in every row and column. For example,

1        2       3       4  
4        1       2       3  
3        4       1       2  
2        3       4       1  


This program takes an incomplete latin square and solves it using Constraint Satisfaction and Backtracking. Look into *instructions* folder for more information about the problem. 

* Algorithims used: Backtracking, Forward Checking 
* Variable Ordering Heuristics Used: Smallest Domain, Brelaz, Minimum Dynamic Degree

### How to use

Run solve.py using python3. Change algorithm and heuristic in config.py
